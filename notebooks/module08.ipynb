    "My algorithm performs an initial check on the guard to ensure they've not gone above the weekly limit before overtime (40 hours). If they have not gone above 40 hours for the week, a day is chosen from the schedule, and if they have not gone above 8 hours for the day, then they can fill the next open hourly slot. This hourly slot is now filled and the algorithm is called recursively until all time slots have been filled. Below we can see that the schedule has indeed been filled. The algorithm is greedy because it fills up the first guard until they hit daily and weekly capacity before moving to the next guard. This can bee seen below whereby the schedule is exactly the same on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. The same three employees work the same hours on those days. After 5 days, each of the 3 guards are full for the week, and the remaining two days are identical for the remaining guards.  \n",

    "My algorithm should be able to handel different hour restrictions easily as long as the duration is within a week. The algorithm fills by the hour by the day, so shift sizes shouldn't be an issue.

    "I'm not entirely sure how to determine my complexity with my nested setup. Each call starts with only 1 guard so that's $O(1)$, then each sub call loops over the days in the week ($O(n)$), then each call underneath that loops through the hours in the day ($O(n)$). This leads me to believe that my overall complexity is $O(n^2)$."

    "Overall, the greedy algorithm implemented does a pretty good job of managing our weekly schedule so that we can properly staff our security detail without paying out overtime for the day or week. Future improvements to our algorithm could include inputs for adjusting hours, max weekly hours, or even monthly hours. If the needs become complex, an alternative optimization solution can be implemented that is better suited to handling a number of contraints.\n",
