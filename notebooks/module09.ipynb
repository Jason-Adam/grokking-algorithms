Determine the maximum value obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces. For example, if length of the rod is 8 and the values of different pieces are given as following then the maximum obtainable value is 22 (by cutting in two pieces of lengths 2 and 6). \n",

    "At first glance the algorithm looks like it's not doing much, but on closer examination, it's building up the best value as it iterates over the prices and lengths. The algorithm takes a list of prices as input and assumes that each price corresponds to a length of wire in ascending order starting at 1.  The algorithm then takes the following steps:  \n",
    "* Create value list that will be continually updated with new information.  \n",
    "* Loop through each possible length (1 - 8) and set max price to -1 for baseline.  \n",
    "* Loop through each value in said length (if length was 2, then algorithm uses 0, 1, 2) - piece variable in code.\n",

    "This is a dynamic programming problem as it keeps track of the optimal solution at each length of the rod instead of processing it all over again or calling it recursively. This allows us to keep the complexity of the algorithm at $O(n^2)$ instead of a possible factorial situation if we were to take every combination of every length to find the best value."

    "## Executive Summary  \n",
    "Overall, this type of solution can be used to quickly and efficiently solve smaller problems that would otherwise become intractable. A rod of 8 potential pieces doesn't have that many combinations, but the numbers grows quickly if the number of potential pieces increases. If data engineers have the baseline knowledge to spot a problem well-suited to a dynamic programming implementation, then the company can benefit tremendously from decreased processing time and increased throughput.\n",
